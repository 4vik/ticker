This app is a proof of concept that was the result of independent study exploring the viability of event synchronization on Android devices using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).  We found that NTP is a possible option when attempting to sync audio or animations across multiple devices.  Note that this source code is meant to work with the Nexus 5, Nexus 7, and Nexus 4 only. That is, all the timing for the animations are based on the sceen size and density of these devices specifically. It can be refactored to work on other devices, you will just have to do a little math. 

For a quick demo, I recommend watching the proof of concept video linked below.  We believe that the applications of NTP synchronization are endless, and our proof of concept only scratches the surface.  For further explanation of our project, I recommend watching our presentation linked below, which was presented to the Boston College Computer Science Department in 2015.
